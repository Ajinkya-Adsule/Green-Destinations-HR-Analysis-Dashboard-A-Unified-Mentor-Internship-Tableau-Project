# Green-Destinations-HR-Analysis-Dashboard-A-Unified-Mentor-Internship-Tableau-Project


Hello Visitor,



I have recently completed  my Tableau project on HR analytics on my GREEN DESTINATION dataset  @ Unified Mentor Private Limited.



*OBJECTIVE*

Green Destinations is a well-known travel agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or patterns. She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided you with the data.

She would like to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left).

She would also like to know if factors like age, years at the company, and Income play a part in determining if people will leave or not.



*SOLUTION*



Created a dashboard in order to visualize the attrition with different parameters like attrition with Education wise Attrition ##, attrition with different department , Job satisfaction levels, and attrition rate among different age Groups as well as  Gender wise Attrition count.



*Conclusion*

The key takeaway from this analysis is that employees in the early stages of their careers are more likely to leave the organization. This suggests that younger or less experienced employees may be seeking better opportunities, faster growth, or more engagement.



** This insight can help HR teams to focus retention efforts more effectively â€” perhaps through mentorship programs, career development plans, or better onboarding for newer employees.**
